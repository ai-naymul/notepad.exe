## Complete Roadmap to Research-Level Mastery

### **Foundation Layer (Months 1-4) - While taking your current course**

**1. Mathematical Foundations** (Critical - can't skip)

- Linear Algebra (deep):
    - Matrix decompositions (SVD, eigendecomposition)
    - Norms and inner product spaces
    - Positive definite matrices
    - **Resource**: Gilbert Strang's MIT Linear Algebra + "Matrix Computations" by Golub
- Calculus & Optimization:
    - Multivariable calculus
    - Gradient descent variants (SGD, Adam, AdaGrad)
    - Convex optimization basics
    - Lagrange multipliers, KKT conditions
    - **Resource**: Boyd's "Convex Optimization" (free online)
- Probability & Statistics:
    - Probability distributions (continuous/discrete)
    - Maximum likelihood estimation
    - Bayesian inference basics
    - Concentration inequalities
    - **Resource**: "Probability and Statistics for Computer Scientists"
- Information Theory:
    - Entropy, cross-entropy, KL divergence
    - Mutual information
    - **Resource**: Cover & Thomas chapters 1-2

**2. Programming Foundations**

- Python (NumPy, PyTorch) - you're doing this
- Implement everything from scratch first before using libraries
- **Key**: Write a neural network from scratch using only NumPy

### **Core Technical Layer (Months 3-8) - Parallel with foundations**

**3. Deep Learning Theory** (beyond your course)

- Backpropagation (derive it mathematically)
- Universal approximation theorem
- Optimization landscapes
- Batch normalization, Layer normalization (why they work)
- Regularization theory (L1, L2, dropout - mathematical basis)
- **Resource**:
    - "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville (the Bible)
    - "Understanding Deep Learning" by Simon Prince (new, excellent)

**4. Advanced Neural Architectures**

- CNNs (ResNet, attention in vision - ViT)
- RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs (vanishing gradients, gating mechanisms)
- Transformers (multi-head attention derivation, positional encoding)
- Graph Neural Networks
- **Implementation**: Code each architecture from scratch, then from papers

**5. Natural Language Processing** (for ACL/NAACL)

- Classic NLP (before deep learning): n-grams, HMMs
- Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe - mathematical derivation)
- Sequence models (seq2seq, attention mechanism origin)
- BERT, GPT architecture details
- Tokenization schemes (BPE, WordPiece)
- **Resource**:
    - Jurafsky & Martin "Speech and Language Processing"
    - "Natural Language Processing with Transformers" (Hugging Face book)

**6. Modern LLM Landscape**

- Scaling laws (Chinchilla, etc.)
- RLHF, DPO, PPO
- Prompting techniques
- RAG architectures
- **Stay current**: Read papers from latest conferences

### **Research Skills Layer (Months 6-12)**

**7. Paper Reading & Analysis**

- **Start NOW**: Read 2-3 papers per week
- Focus areas based on interest:
    - NLP: ACL, NAACL, EMNLP, TACL
    - ML: NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR
    - Vision: CVPR, ICCV, ECCV
- **Method**:
    - First pass: skim (10 min)
    - Second pass: understand (1 hour)
    - Third pass: implement key ideas (several hours)
    - Write summary with critical analysis

**8. Research Methodology**

- How to identify research gaps
- Experimental design
- Ablation studies
- Statistical significance testing
- Writing research papers
- **Resource**:
    - "How to Write a Great Research Paper" (Simon Peyton Jones talk)
    - Read meta-reviews from past conferences

**9. Reproduce Important Papers**

- Pick 5-10 influential papers
- Reproduce their experiments exactly
- This teaches you what actually matters
- **Start with**: "Attention is All You Need", BERT, GPT-2

### **Specialization Layer (Months 9-15)**

**10. Pick Your Research Direction** Based on your interests, deep dive into ONE of these:

**For NLP (ACL/NAACL/EMNLP):**

- Efficient transformers
- Multilingual NLP
- Low-resource language modeling
- Interpretability
- Factual knowledge in LLMs
- Reasoning capabilities

**For ML (NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR):**

- Optimization algorithms
- Generalization theory
- Meta-learning
- Efficient training/inference
- Federated learning

**Bengali/Bangla NLP** (Your advantage!):

- Bengali language resources are limited
- You can contribute significantly here
- Lower competition, high impact
- Potential for ACL/NAACL papers

**11. Advanced Topics in Your Area**

- Read ALL recent papers in your chosen subfield
- Implement key techniques
- Maintain a research log
- Identify what's missing/broken

### **Publication Preparation (Months 12-18)**

**12. Start Research Projects**

- Begin with replication studies
- Extend existing work
- Compare methods
- Build datasets (especially for Bengali NLP!)
- **Goal**: 1-2 workshop papers first, then conference papers

**13. Build Research Network**

- Twitter/X: Follow researchers in your area
- Participate in discussions
- Email professors whose work you admire (with thoughtful questions)
- Contribute to open source
- Attend virtual conferences/workshops

DET (Duolingo English Test) can usually replace **TOEFL/IELTS** (English proficiency).
But **DET cannot replace SAT/ACT** (standardized admissions testing). They’re two different requirements—and many schools treat them independently. Harvard and Penn explicitly say English exams don’t substitute for the SAT/ACT requirement. ([Harvard College][1])

## Do you need BOTH SAT and an English test?

It depends on the university:

* **If the school requires SAT/ACT (or “test-flexible” equivalents)** → you must submit that *even if* you submit DET. ([Harvard College][1])
* **If the school is test-optional for SAT/ACT** → SAT is optional, but **English proof may still be required** (often waived only if you had enough years of English-medium schooling). ([Brown University Admissions][2])
* **Some schools don’t require any English exam** for undergrad, but may still accept it if you want to submit. ([Harvard College][1])

## For the universities you listed (what’s required vs optional)

## So what should you do for your 2027 plan?

* If you’re applying to **any** of: Harvard / Stanford / MIT / Penn / Dartmouth → **you should plan to take SAT (or equivalent) + likely also submit DET** (or qualify for a waiver where allowed). ([Harvard College][1])
* DET is widely accepted, but the fastest way to verify for *any* school is Duolingo’s official “accepting institutions” directory. ([Duolingo English Test][18])

If you want, paste your **target intake term** (Fall 2027 vs Fall 2028) and I’ll map *exactly* which of your listed schools require SAT/ACT that cycle and which ones let you skip it.

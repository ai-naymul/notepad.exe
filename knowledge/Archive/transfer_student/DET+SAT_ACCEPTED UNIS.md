Most U.S. universities treat the **Duolingo English Test (DET)** as an **English-proficiency** option (instead of TOEFL/IELTS). Separately, **SAT** is a **standardized admissions test**—many schools **accept it if submitted**, and some **require** it (policies have been changing a lot lately).

## The fastest way to get “all universities that accept DET”

Duolingo maintains an official searchable directory of **accepting institutions** (you can filter to the United States). ([Duolingo English Test](https://englishtest.duolingo.com/test_takers/accepting_institutions?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Accepting Institutions - Duolingo English Test"))

## Examples: DET accepted + SAT is accepted (transfer-focused)

Below are schools where (a) DET is accepted/allowed and (b) SAT is accepted (required or optional), based on official admissions pages.

### One important warning

Some universities/programs **do not accept DET** (or only accept it for certain programs), so always verify per school. Example: University of Chicago’s grad division explicitly says it does **not** accept Duolingo. ([UChicagoGRAD | The University of Chicago](https://grad.uchicago.edu/admissions/apply/english-language-requirements/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "English Language Proficiency - UChicagoGRAD"))

If you tell me **your target intake term** (e.g., “Fall 2028 transfer”), I can tighten this into a **priority shortlist** of “best chance + best full funding” schools that also match the **SAT/DET** combo.

# Your Actual Routine — Feb 10, 2026 Onwards

## Built for Reality, Not Ambition Theater

---

## The Hard Truth First

IIUC is a small, unknown university in Bangladesh. No US admissions officer has heard of it. When they see your transcript, they won't think "oh, a 4.0 from IIUC, impressive" — they'll think "who is this person and why should we take a chance on them?"

This means your GPA alone won't carry you. A 4.0 from IIUC ≠ a 4.0 from BUET in their eyes. You need **overwhelming evidence** that you're exceptional despite the institution:

- A paper at EMNLP/ACL says "this person does real research at a global level"
- DET 125+ / SAT 1450+ says "this person can handle English-medium instruction"
- AIMarketCap (1M+ users) + Drishtikon says "this person builds real things that people use"
- LangChain / open source contributions say "this person operates in global engineering communities"

Your GPA still matters (they'll question a low one), but it's the **combination** that overcomes the IIUC bias. One publication at a top venue does more for your application than the difference between a 3.9 and 4.0.

**So the priority order shifts slightly:**

|Rank|Activity|Why It Overcomes the Bias|
|---|---|---|
|**#1**|IIUC GPA (4.0)|Table stakes — bad GPA = instant reject|
|**#2**|Research paper (EMNLP)|THE differentiator. Proves global-level ability|
|**#3**|Freelance (income)|You need to eat. Also builds your "builder" narrative|
|**#4**|DET + SAT|Gatekeepers. Must pass, but won't make you special|
|**#5**|CP / ICPC|Backup plan + demonstrates raw problem-solving|
|**#6**|Open source + projects|Supporting evidence, not primary|
|**#7**|External courses|For your growth, invisible on application|

## Your Real Constraints

- **Class days:** Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday (5 days)
- **At IIUC:** 8:30 AM – 5:30 PM (includes ~1-2 hours of breaks in between)
- **Weekends:** Thursday + Friday
- **After 5:30 PM you're burnt out.** This is a fact, not a weakness.
- **Commute eats time.** Let's say 30 min each way.
- **You need rest, a walk, and food.** Non-negotiable.

**Realistic evening window on class days:** 6:00 PM – 12:30 AM = ~6.5 hours But you're tired. The first hour is recovery. Honest productive time = **~5 hours/evening.**

---

## CLASS DAYS (Saturday – Wednesday)

### Morning: Before IIUC

**6:15 AM** — Wake up, shower, get ready

**6:45–7:15 AM** — DET/English practice (30 min)

- Duolingo app, vocabulary cards, or a quick reading exercise
- Low effort, high consistency. Do this half-asleep, it still counts.
- _30 min/day × 5 days = 2.5 hrs/week of test prep with zero willpower needed_

**7:15–7:30 AM** — Breakfast

**7:30–8:00 AM** — Commute to IIUC

### At IIUC: 8:30 AM – 5:30 PM

**During classes:** Be fully present. Front row. Take notes. Ask questions. This is the most efficient path to 4.0 — understanding in class means less studying later.

**During breaks (~1-2 hrs total across the day):**

Use the library or a quiet spot. Pick ONE per break:

|If break is...|Do this|
|---|---|
|30 min|Review the lecture you just had. Re-read notes. Mark confusing parts.|
|45 min|Solve 2-3 Codeforces problems (Div 2 A/B level). Keep CP muscle alive.|
|60 min|Collect 5-8 BengaliBench questions from your phone/laptop. Or read 1 paper.|
|You're exhausted|Rest. Close your eyes. Eat something. A rested brain in the next class > forced productivity.|

**Do NOT do freelance in breaks.** It needs focus you don't have in 30-min fragments.

### After IIUC: The Evening

**5:30–6:00 PM** — Commute home

**6:00–6:45 PM** — Decompress + Walk (45 min)

- Change clothes, eat a light snack
- **Go for your walk NOW**, not later. You asked for this.
- Walk for 20-30 min. No laptop. No studying. Just move.
- This is the transition between "student mode" and "evening work mode"

**6:45–7:30 PM** — Dinner + full rest (45 min)

- Eat a real meal. Talk to family.
- You've been at uni for 9 hours. You earned this.

**7:30–9:30 PM** — Research Block (2 hrs)

- This is your most important evening block.
- **Sat/Mon/Wed:** BengaliBench question collection + annotation
    - Target: 10-15 questions per session
    - SSC/HSC textbooks, Bengali proverbs, safety scenarios
- **Sun/Tue:** Paper writing + reading related work
    - Draft sections, read benchmark papers, run model evaluations
    - Read Between Lines expansion (15-20 min within this block)

_Why research at 7:30, not freelance?_ Because you're still somewhat fresh. Research needs creative thinking. Freelance is more mechanical (you already know how to code). Give your best remaining energy to the thing that matters most for transfer.

**9:30–9:45 PM** — Short break (15 min)

- Tea, stretch, bathroom. Reset.

**9:45 PM–12:15 AM** — Freelance Work (2.5 hrs)

- Active client project work
- If no active project: Drishtikon features, AIMarketCap, or searching for new clients
- This is your income block. It's later because it's more execution than creation.

**12:15–12:30 AM** — Wind down

- Set alarm, glance at tomorrow's schedule, done.

**12:30 AM** — Sleep (6 hrs → wake 6:15)

---

### Class Day Summary

|Block|Time|Hours|What|
|---|---|---|---|
|DET practice|6:45–7:15|0.5|English test prep|
|IIUC (class)|8:30–5:30|9.0|Classes + break productivity|
|Walk + decompress|6:00–6:45|0.75|Health + transition|
|Dinner + rest|6:45–7:30|0.75|Recovery|
|Research|7:30–9:30|2.0|BengaliBench|
|Freelance|9:45–12:15|2.5|Income|
|**Evening productive**||**~5.0**||
|**Sleep**|12:30–6:15|**~6**||

I know 6 hours of sleep is tight. On days you can afford it, sleep at 12:00 instead of 12:30. Weekends will compensate.

## THURSDAY (Weekend Day 1 — Deep Work Day)

This is your most valuable day. No IIUC. This is where you make real progress on things you can't do in 2-hour evening blocks.

**8:00 AM** — Wake up (sleep in 1.75 hrs — earned)

**8:00–8:30** — Morning routine + breakfast

**8:30–9:15 AM** — DET/SAT Practice (45 min)

- Thursday mornings: full practice section or mock test segment
- Once SAT prep starts (May/Jun): alternate DET and SAT

**9:15 AM–12:15 PM** — CP / ICPC Deep Session (3 hrs)

- Virtual contest on Codeforces, or targeted problem set
- Work through problems at your edge (not easy ones, not impossible ones)
- This is your ONLY dedicated CP block for the week. Make it count.
- _Why Thursday morning?_ Freshest mind of the week after rest.

**12:15–1:15 PM** — Lunch + rest (1 hr)

**1:15–2:00 PM** — Walk / Exercise (45 min)

**2:00–5:00 PM** — Research Deep Work (3 hrs)

- BengaliBench: bulk work that can't be done in 2-hr evening slots
    - Running model evaluations (these take time)
    - Writing full paper sections
    - Quality control + inter-annotator agreement calculations
    - Batch question collection (30-40 questions in one session)
- Phone on silent. No Slack. No freelance.

**5:00–5:30 PM** — Break

**5:30–7:30 PM** — Freelance Work (2 hrs)

- Catch up on weekly client commitments
- This compensates for any weekday freelance shortfall

**7:30–8:15 PM** — Dinner

**8:15–10:15 PM** — Flexible Block (2 hrs)

- Rotate based on what's most needed:
    - Behind on IIUC homework → study
    - External coursework (MIT/Harvard ML courses)
    - Open source contributions (LangChain, browser-use)
    - Extra research if paper deadline approaching
    - Extra CP if contest is this weekend

**10:15–11:30 PM** — Personal time (1.25 hrs)

- Whatever you want. Gaming, YouTube, friends, phone.
- Guilt-free. This is fuel, not waste.

**11:30 PM** — Sleep

## FRIDAY (Weekend Day 2 — Flex + Recovery)

Friday is your buffer + recovery day. Some weeks you'll be behind, some weeks you'll feel good. This day adapts.

**9:00 AM** — Wake up (latest of the week — full recovery sleep)

**9:00–9:30** — Morning routine

**9:30–10:30 AM** — Weekly Review (1 hr)

- Pull out a notebook or open Notion. Answer honestly:
    - IIUC: Attendance 100%? Assignments done? Understanding solid?
    - Research: How many benchmark questions this week? (Target: 50-75/week)
    - DET: Practiced every day? (Target: 5/5 class days + 1 Thursday)
    - CP: Problems solved? (Target: 8-12/week across breaks + Thursday)
    - Freelance: Hours hit? Client happy?
- Plan next week's priorities. What's the ONE thing that matters most?

**10:30 AM–12:30 PM** — Catch-Up Block (2 hrs)

- Whatever is most behind from the week:
    - IIUC homework not done? → Do it now
    - Research question quota short? → Collect now
    - Freelance deadline Monday? → Work on it now
    - Nothing behind? → Extra CP or paper writing

**12:30–1:30 PM** — Lunch

**1:30–2:30 PM** — Nap / Full Rest (1 hr)

- Actually rest. You ran a 5-day marathon of 8:30 AM – 12:30 AM days.
- Your body needs this. Your brain consolidates learning during rest.

**2:30–3:15 PM** — Walk / Exercise (45 min)

**3:15–5:15 PM** — Deep Work Block (2 hrs)

- Rotating focus:
    - Week 1 of month: Extra research (paper writing)
    - Week 2: External coursework (MIT/Harvard)
    - Week 3: Open source contributions
    - Week 4: IIUC exam prep / review

**5:15–6:00 PM** — Break + prayer

**6:00–8:00 PM** — Freelance / Projects (2 hrs)

- Wrap up weekly freelance quota
- Or Drishtikon / AIMarketCap maintenance

**8:00–9:00 PM** — Dinner + Family (1 hr)

**9:00–11:00 PM** — Personal Time (2 hrs)

- This is your weekend night. No work.
- Games, movies, friends, whatever recharges you.
- **This is not optional.** Skipping rest → burnout → you drop everything for a week → net negative.

**11:00–11:30 PM** — Light prep for Saturday (first class day)

- Glance at tomorrow's class schedule
- Pack bag

**11:30 PM** — Sleep (early for Saturday 6:15 AM wake)

## What Makes This Actually Followable

**1. You only have 3 things to do each evening (class days):** Walk → Research → Freelance. That's it. Not 7 activities with 15-minute transitions.

**2. All the "nice to have" stuff lives on weekends:** CP deep work, external courses, open source — they have dedicated Thursday/Friday slots, not crammed into exhausted weeknight hours.

**3. Rest is scheduled, not something you "find time for":** Friday afternoon nap. Friday night off. Saturday (class day) you'll be tired, but you slept well Friday night.

**4. The break-time choices are flexible:** Some days you'll smash CP problems in breaks. Some days you'll stare at the wall. Both are fine. The evening blocks are what matter.

## Overcoming the IIUC Bias: What to Focus Energy On

Since nobody knows IIUC, here's what actually builds your case:

**In the next 5 months (Feb–Jun):**

|Evidence|How It Helps|Your Action|
|---|---|---|
|BengaliBench paper submitted to EMNLP|"He does real research independently"|10-15 hrs/week of research|
|4.0 GPA at IIUC|"He's serious about academics"|Full attention in class + evening study|
|DET 125+|"He can function in English"|30 min/day habit|
|Open source commits (LangChain)|"He contributes to global projects"|Thursday flexible block|
|Drishtikon live + growing|"He ships products that matter"|Freelance block maintenance|

**Things that DON'T help your transfer app but are worth doing anyway:**

- ICPC prep → backup plan if transfer fails, and impressive later
- MIT/Harvard courseware → makes you a better engineer
- These go in weekend flexible blocks, not prime time

## Start Today (Feb 10)

It's Tuesday. You have class tomorrow (Wednesday), then Thursday is your first real weekend day with this routine.

**Tonight:**

1. Set alarm for 6:15 AM
2. Do your freelance block (9:45 PM – 12:15 AM)
3. Sleep by 12:30

**Tomorrow (Wednesday) — first full class day with new routine:**

1. 6:45 AM: 30 min DET practice
2. 8:30–5:30: IIUC (use 1 break for 5 BengaliBench questions)
3. 6:00 PM: Walk
4. 7:30 PM: Research (2 hrs)
5. 9:45 PM: Freelance (2.5 hrs)
6. 12:30: Sleep

**Thursday — first weekend day:** Follow the Thursday template. CP deep work in the morning. Research deep work in the afternoon.

**Run this for 2 weeks. Track what actually happens. Then we adjust.**

# Your Actual Routine — Feb 10, 2026 Onwards

## Built from First Principles, Not Wishful Thinking

---

## Why Your Previous Roadmap Failed

That 500-line roadmap tried to schedule 95+ hours/week across 6 parallel tracks. You're human. The reason you couldn't follow it is because **no one can follow a plan that requires perfection every single day for 15 months.** The plan was a strategy document, not a routine.

This is different. This is what you actually do each day.

---

## First Principles Reality Check

**What actually gets you into a top US university as a transfer?**

1. **4.0 GPA at IIUC** — This is the single highest-leverage thing. Without it, nothing else matters. Admissions officers see your transcript first.
2. **A published paper at a top venue** — One strong EMNLP/ACL paper > five mediocre projects. This is your differentiator from thousands of other transfer applicants.
3. **DET/TOEFL + SAT scores** — These are gatekeepers. You need 125+ DET and 1450+ SAT. They don't make you special, but missing them kills your app.
4. **A compelling narrative** — Your story (Bengali AI, Drishtikon, AIMarketCap) is already strong. You don't need more projects. You need depth in existing ones.

**What does NOT move the needle as much as you think?**

- Doing 10 things at once. Admissions doesn't count activities — they look for depth and impact.
- ICPC World Finals prep right now. This is a 2-3 year goal. If you spread yourself thin on CP while tanking GPA or missing paper deadlines, you lose both.
- Taking MIT/Harvard courseware simultaneously. You're already taking a full IIUC course load. External courses are for summer/breaks.

---

## Your Actual Constraints

- **IIUC classes:** Sun–Thu, ~8 AM to ~2-3 PM (with breaks between)
- **Weekend:** Fri–Sat (Bangladesh)
- **Lecture Period I:** Feb 7 – Apr 4 (you're in Week 1 right now)
- **Midterms:** Apr 6–20
- **You need:** afternoon walk, daytime rest, sanity
- **Freelance income:** non-negotiable, 2-4 hrs/day
- **Sleep:** 7-8 hours minimum (you historically sleep late — we work WITH that, not against it)

---

## The Priority Stack (Feb–Apr 2026)

You can't do everything equally. Here's the honest ranking for THIS period:

|Rank|Activity|Why|Weekly Hours|
|---|---|---|---|
|**#1**|IIUC coursework (class + study)|4.0 GPA is non-negotiable|30-35|
|**#2**|Research (BengaliBench)|Paper submission = transfer success|10-12|
|**#3**|Freelance work|Income needed|14-18|
|**#4**|CP / ICPC prep|Long-term skill + backup plan|5-7|
|**#5**|DET/SAT prep|Light daily habit now, intensive later|5-7|
|**#6**|External courses (MIT/Harvard)|Only during gaps/weekends|3-5|
|**#7**|Health (walk, rest)|Non-negotiable for sustainability|7|

**Total: ~74-91 hrs/week across everything (including class time)**

This is tight but honest. You're awake ~16-17 hrs/day × 7 = ~112-119 hrs. After meals, hygiene, transitions, you realistically have ~95-100 usable hours. This leaves buffer.

## Your Weekly Template

### SUNDAY – THURSDAY (Class Days)

Your IIUC classes run roughly 8 AM – 2/3 PM with breaks between. I'm giving you a **flexible framework** — you slot your actual class times in.

---

**6:30 AM — Wake Up + Morning Routine** (30 min)

- Shower, get ready
- No phone scrolling. Grab water.

**7:00–7:45 AM — DET/English Practice** (45 min)

- Duolingo English Test practice OR vocabulary flashcards
- This is low-cognitive-load, perfect for morning warmup
- _Why morning:_ Consistency. Small daily habit > weekend cramming

**7:45–8:00 AM — Commute / Prep for Class**

**8:00 AM – 2:30 PM — IIUC Block** (~6.5 hrs including breaks)

- **During classes:** 100% focus. Sit front. Take notes. Ask questions.
- **During breaks between classes (30-60 min gaps):**
    - Option A: Review previous lecture notes (15 min) — reinforces GPA
    - Option B: Read 1 research paper on phone/laptop (if break > 45 min)
    - Option C: Do 2-3 CP problems on phone (Codeforces easy/medium)
    - Option D: Rest if tired. Seriously. A rested brain in the next class > grinding in breaks
    - **Do NOT do freelance work in breaks.** Context switching kills focus.

**2:30–3:30 PM — Lunch + Decompression** (1 hr)

- Eat properly
- Light phone time, social, whatever
- No guilt. This is recovery.

**3:30–4:15 PM — Walk / Exercise** (45 min)

- Go outside. Walk around campus or neighborhood.
- No headphones with lectures. Listen to music or podcast or nothing.
- This is for your body and mental health. Non-negotiable.

**4:15–4:30 PM — Transition** (15 min)

- Water, settle at desk, open laptop

**4:30–6:30 PM — IIUC Study / Homework** (2 hrs)

- Review today's lectures
- Complete assignments (always finish 2 days before deadline)
- Practice problems for math/physics/programming courses
- _Why now:_ Material is fresh from morning classes. Best retention window.

**6:30–7:15 PM — Dinner + Prayer/Break** (45 min)

**7:15–9:15 PM — Research Work (BengaliBench)** (2 hrs)

- **Mon/Wed:** Collect benchmark questions (target: 15-20 questions per session)
    - Academic domain: SSC/HSC textbooks
    - Cultural domain: Bengali idioms, proverbs
    - Safety domain: Bias test cases
- **Tue/Thu:** Read papers + write sections of your paper
    - Literature review, methodology, related work
    - Run model evaluations when infrastructure is ready
- **Sun:** Weekly research planning + Read Between Lines expansion (30 min) + BengaliBench

**9:15–9:30 PM — Short Break** (15 min)

**9:30 PM–12:00 AM — Freelance Work** (2.5 hrs)

- Client projects, AIMarketCap, Drishtikon maintenance
- Time-boxed. When midnight hits, you stop. No exceptions.
- If you have no active freelance project: use this for CP practice or open source

**12:00–12:30 AM — Wind Down** (30 min)

- Light reading, personal time
- Plan tomorrow (2 min — just glance at calendar)
- No new work starts after midnight

**12:30 AM — Sleep**

- Target: 6.5-7 hrs. You wake at 6:30, so lights out by 12:30.

### SATURDAY (Weekend Day 2 — Flex + Recovery)

Saturday is your buffer day. Some weeks you'll need catch-up. Some weeks you'll feel good and push hard. Build in flexibility.

## The Rules

### Rule 1: GPA Comes First, Always

If you're behind on IIUC coursework, it eats into research time, then freelance time, then CP time. Never the other way around. A 3.7 GPA with an EMNLP paper is worse than a 4.0 GPA with a paper under review.

### Rule 2: Time-Box Everything

When the clock says your block is over, you stop. Freelance at midnight? Done. Research at 9:15? Done. The discipline of stopping is harder than the discipline of starting, but it prevents one activity from eating all others.

### Rule 3: Protect Your Walk

You said it yourself — sitting all day will wreck you. The 45-min afternoon walk is sacred. Rain? Walk with an umbrella. Tired? Walk slowly. The only excuse is genuine illness.

### Rule 4: Saturday Night is Off

9 PM Saturday to sleep = your time. No work. No guilt. This is what keeps you going for months instead of burning out in weeks.

### Rule 5: Track Weekly, Not Daily

Don't beat yourself up if Tuesday was bad. Look at the week: did you hit ~80% of targets? That's success. Adjust next week. Daily tracking creates anxiety. Weekly tracking creates momentum.

### Rule 6: ICPC Is a Marathon

You're not going to World Finals this year. The CP block (Friday mornings + break-time problems) builds the muscle over months. Consistent 5-7 hrs/week for a year > cramming 20 hrs/week for a month then quitting.

### Rule 7: One Freelance Project at a Time

You said this yourself. Don't stack clients. Finish one, start another. Protects your time and your quality.

## Phase Adjustments

This routine is for **Feb 10 – Apr 4** (Lecture Period I).

### Midterm Mode (Apr 6–20):

- **Pause:** Research, CP, external courses, open source
- **Reduce:** Freelance to minimum (1 hr/day)
- **Increase:** IIUC study to 6-8 hrs/day
- **Keep:** DET practice (30 min/day only), walk, rest

### Post-Midterm (Apr 21 – Jun 30):

- **Increase:** Research to 3 hrs/day (paper deadline approaching)
- **Add:** SAT prep (replace some DET time)
- **Keep:** Everything else same

### Finals Mode (Jul 4–27):

- Same as Midterm Mode. GPA above all.

### Summer Sprint (Aug):

- SAT exam on Aug 22
- Essay writing begins
- Research paper should be submitted by now

---

## What You Should Do TODAY (Feb 10)

1. **Set your alarms:** 6:30 AM for tomorrow (Sunday)
2. **Download Toggl or use your phone timer** — track actual hours this week to see if this routine is realistic for YOUR class schedule
3. **Print or save this routine** somewhere you'll see it every morning
4. **Identify your break times at IIUC** — write down your actual class schedule so you know when breaks are
5. **Do tonight's freelance block** (9:30 PM – 12:00 AM) and then STOP

That's it. Don't try to "catch up" on everything tonight. Start the routine tomorrow morning.

## The Honest Truth

You want ICPC World Finals AND top US transfer AND research publications AND freelance income AND external courses. That's 5 ambitious goals. Most people pursue 1-2 at a time.

You CAN pursue all of them — but not all at maximum intensity simultaneously. This routine gives each one a real slot, but the honest truth is:

- **Feb–Jul 2026:** GPA + Research + DET are the priorities (they directly feed your transfer app)
- **ICPC prep is a slow burn** — 5-7 hrs/week now, scaling up if transfer doesn't work out
- **External courses are supplementary** — they make you a better engineer but don't directly appear on your transfer app
- **Freelance is survival income** — do the minimum viable work, not maximum

If you get into a top US university, you'll have world-class resources for ICPC, courses, and research. Getting there is the bottleneck. Focus accordingly.

**Execute this for 2 weeks. Then adjust based on what actually happened, not what you wished happened.**
